Introduction
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory and cognitive function. Early prediction can help in managing and potentially slowing the progression of the disease. This application allows users to input various health metrics and receive a prediction on the likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease.

Features
User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit.
Health Data Input: Users can input various health metrics such as age, BMI, cholesterol levels, and more.
Prediction Results: The app provides a prediction on the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease.
Health Recommendations: Based on the prediction, users receive health advice and recommendations.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Steps
Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/emmychesh/alzheimer-disease-prediction.git
cd alzheimers-prediction
Install Dependencies:
Make sure to have pip updated to the latest version, then install the necessary packages:


pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:


streamlit run app.py
This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your web browser.

Usage
Input Health Data:
Use the sidebar to enter your health data, including age, BMI, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors.

Get Prediction:
Click the "Predict" button to get a prediction on the likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease.

View Results:
The application will display the prediction along with some health recommendations.

Model Details
The prediction model is built using the CatBoost library, a gradient boosting algorithm that handles categorical data efficiently. The model was trained on a dataset containing various health metrics.
